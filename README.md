This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming problems in various languages.
I have mostly used these problems to learn new programming languages, so if you are well-versed in one of the languages I am using and have any recommendations as to how I can improve my code, please let me know!
Merry Christmas!
